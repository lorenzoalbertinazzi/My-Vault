## Summary
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that enhances large language models (LLMs) by grounding their responses in dynamically retrieved external documents rather than relying solely on parametric memory baked into weights at training time. First proposed by Lewis et al. (Meta AI, 2020), RAG has become the dominant pattern for building knowledge-intensive AI applications because it reduces hallucinations, keeps information current without retraining, and provides transparent sourcing.

## Key Points
- RAG = Retriever + Generator: a retrieval system finds relevant documents; an LLM reads them to produce grounded answers
- **Vector embeddings** encode semantic meaning numerically; cosine similarity retrieves the most relevant chunks
- The core pipeline: Query → Embed query → Vector search → Retrieve top-k chunks → Augment prompt → LLM generates answer
- RAG solves the **knowledge cutoff problem** and dramatically reduces hallucination rates on factual queries
- **Chunking strategy** is one of the highest-leverage decisions in RAG quality
- Advanced patterns: HyDE, re-ranking, parent-child chunking, query decomposition, recursive RAG

## Details

### Why RAG Exists: The Core Problem

LLMs learn facts from their training data and store them in their billions of parameters (hence "parametric memory"). This creates three problems:
1. **Knowledge cutoff**: the model knows nothing after its training date
2. **Hallucination**: when the model lacks a fact, it often confabulates a plausible-sounding answer
3. **No sourcing**: users cannot verify where a claim came from

The naive solution — retraining or fine-tuning the model on new data — is prohibitively expensive for most use cases and still doesn't provide citation-level traceability.

RAG solves this by externalizing knowledge. Instead of baking facts into weights, you retrieve them at inference time from a live, updateable knowledge base.

### Core Architecture

```
User Query
    │
    ▼
[Query Encoder / Embedding Model]
    │  (converts query to dense vector)
    ▼
[Vector Store / Index]  ◄─── Pre-indexed Documents
    │  (ANN search: returns top-k most similar chunks)
    ▼
[Retrieved Chunks (Context)]
    │
    ▼
[Prompt Assembly]
    │  "Answer the question using the context below: <chunks> \n\n Question: <query>"
    ▼
[LLM Generator]
    │
    ▼
[Grounded Response + Citations]
```

### Step 1: Document Ingestion and Chunking

Before retrieval can happen, documents must be indexed. The pipeline:

1. **Load** raw documents (PDFs, web pages, databases, APIs)
2. **Clean** (strip HTML, normalise whitespace)
3. **Chunk** — split into segments the LLM can process
4. **Embed** each chunk using an embedding model
5. **Store** in a vector database

**Chunking strategies** — arguably the most important RAG design decision:

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed-size (token) chunking** | Split every N tokens with overlap | Simple baseline |
| **Sentence/paragraph splitting** | Split at natural boundaries | General text |
| **Semantic chunking** | Group sentences by semantic similarity | Heterogeneous documents |
| **Parent-child chunking** | Small chunks for retrieval, large parent chunks for context | Precise retrieval + full context |
| **Recursive character splitting** | Try multiple separators hierarchically | Code, structured text |

**Overlap**: adding 10–20% overlap between chunks prevents answers spanning chunk boundaries from being missed.

### Step 2: Embedding Models

An embedding model converts text to a dense vector (e.g., 1536 dimensions). Similar texts have vectors with high cosine similarity.

Popular embedding models:
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small/large**: strong general-purpose performance
- **Cohere Embed v3**: multilingual, efficient
- **BGE / E5 (BAAI)**: high-performing open-source options
- **Jina Embeddings**: long-context specialised
- **Voyage AI**: often top-of-leaderboard on MTEB benchmarks

Key properties: **context length** (how much text per chunk), **dimensionality** (higher = more expressive but more storage), **domain specificity** (code, legal, medical embeddings exist).

### Step 3: Vector Databases

Vector databases store embeddings and perform Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search at scale.

| Database | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Pinecone** | Fully managed, production-grade |
| **Weaviate** | Open source, strong hybrid search |
| **Qdrant** | Open source, Rust-based, fast |
| **Chroma** | Lightweight, great for development |
| **pgvector** | Postgres extension — vectors inside existing DB |
| **FAISS** | Meta's in-memory library, not a full DB |
| **Milvus** | Enterprise open-source scale |

**Hybrid search**: combining dense vector search (semantic) with sparse BM25 keyword search often outperforms either alone. Useful when exact term matching matters (proper nouns, SKUs, codes).

### Step 4: Retrieval Quality

Metrics:
- **Recall@k**: percentage of truly relevant documents in the top-k results
- **Precision@k**: percentage of retrieved documents that are actually relevant
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: how early the first relevant result appears
- **NDCG**: accounts for graded relevance and rank position

**Re-ranking**: a second-stage model (e.g., Cohere Reranker, cross-encoder) scores the top-k retrieved chunks for relevance to the specific query. Computationally expensive but significantly improves precision.

### Step 5: Prompt Augmentation and Generation

The retrieved chunks are injected into the prompt context window:

```
System: You are a helpful assistant. Answer using ONLY the context provided. 
If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't know."

Context:
[Chunk 1 text]
---
[Chunk 2 text]
---
[Chunk 3 text]

User: What is the refund policy?
```

**Critical design choices:**
- **Context window management**: with many chunks, prioritise most relevant, or use a "lost in the middle" mitigation strategy (most important content at start and end)
- **Citation instructions**: instruct the LLM to cite specific chunks (enables verifiability)
- **Handling "no answer found"**: explicit instruction to abstain reduces hallucination

### Advanced RAG Patterns

**HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**: instead of embedding the query directly, use the LLM to generate a hypothetical answer, then embed that. The hypothetical answer's embedding is closer in space to real document embeddings, improving recall.

**Query Decomposition / Multi-query retrieval**: break complex queries into sub-questions, retrieve for each, then synthesise. Improves coverage for multi-part questions.

**Agentic RAG / Self-RAG**: the LLM decides whether to retrieve, what to retrieve, and whether retrieved content is sufficient. Allows iterative retrieval until confidence threshold is met.

**Recursive retrieval (RAG over RAG)**: first retrieve a summary index to identify relevant document sections, then retrieve fine-grained chunks only from those sections — reduces noise.

**RAPTOR**: hierarchically cluster and summarise document chunks, enabling retrieval at multiple levels of abstraction.

### Evaluation Framework

RAG quality is assessed at three levels:

| Component | What to measure | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval** | Are the right chunks retrieved? | Recall@k, NDCG |
| **Generation** | Is the answer faithful to retrieved context? | Faithfulness (RAGAS) |
| **End-to-end** | Is the final answer correct? | Answer Relevancy, F1 |

**RAGAS** (RAG Assessment) is the dominant open-source framework. Key metrics:
- **Faithfulness**: does the answer stick to retrieved context (no hallucination)?
- **Answer Relevancy**: how relevant is the answer to the question?
- **Context Precision/Recall**: did retrieval find the right and complete context?

### When NOT to Use RAG

RAG is powerful but not always the right tool:
- **Structured queries over databases** → use Text-to-SQL instead
- **Simple FAQ matching** → fine-tuned classifier or keyword search may be faster
- **Real-time computation** → RAG retrieves documents, not live APIs; use function calling
- **Very long document reasoning** → sometimes full-document context (very long context LLMs) beats RAG
- **Low-latency applications** → each RAG call adds latency (embedding + retrieval + reranking)

### Production Considerations

- **Embedding model consistency**: you MUST use the same embedding model at indexing and query time; changing models requires full re-indexing
- **Chunk version control**: when documents update, delta-index only changed chunks
- **Security**: filter retrieval results by user access permissions before injecting into prompt (authorization must happen at retrieval layer)
- **Observability**: log every retrieval call — what was retrieved, what was generated, user feedback — to continuously improve
